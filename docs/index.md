# Integrating an app with Branch
> Hyperlinks can navigate to your website, but not to your app. Branch fixes this with deep links.

> Branch will grow your app by allowing users to install, open, and navigate to content inside your app.

> Increase discovery of your app by sharing its content, converting web users to app users, enabling user-to-user sharing, personalizing user experiences, tracking users, tracking referrals, tracking campaigns, tracking conversions, and increasing overall engagement.
